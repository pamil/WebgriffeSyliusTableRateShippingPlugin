    In order to get a proper margin on shipping cost
    As a Store Owner
    I want to charge different fees for different shipment weights

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And the store has a product "Bottle of water" which weights 1 kg
        And the store has a shipping table rate "Weight-based" for currency "USD"
        And it has a rate "$5.00" for shipments up to 5 kg
        And it has a rate "$10.00" for shipments up to 20 kg
        And the store has "Basic" shipping method using "Weight-based" table rate for "United States" channel
        And I am a logged in customer
